# These are some project ideas
1. 2D Game (Java)
* Sidescroller (like Mario)
* RPG (like Zelda)

2. 3D Game using Unreal Engine
* Some sort of FPS

3. Android/Web Game  
* Online drawing game somewhat similar to Draw Something :pencil2:
  * __Use HTML5 and JS first and then convert to Android/iOS?__
  * This method allows for cross-platform play without having to worry about writing an app for each device (like using Java for Android and Swift for iOS). However, the performance of the app is usually much lower than making a native app. Do we really care about that though? [Comparison Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TRZL5Q9f8Q)
  * [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) wraps a web app as native so it runs better (best method?)
  * [Example of PhoneGap](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/how-to-convert-your-javascript-app-into-an-android-app-with-phonegap/)
  * [Here's how to do this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12840977/convert-html5-into-standalone-android-app)

)

4. Neural networks/deep learning
* Face recognition/image processing

5. API stuff
* Using data from other people in order to make things like weather apps, making your own reddit app, etc.
* [Some different ones here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3wrswc/what_are_some_fun_apis_to_play_with/?st=j86hwwvd&sh=106ea346)
